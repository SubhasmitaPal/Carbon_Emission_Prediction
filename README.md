# Carbon_Emission_Prediction

This project focuses on the analysis of country-specific data and the development of machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions based on a wide range of environmental, economic, demographic, and climatic parameters.

##Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build predictive models that estimate **CO₂ emissions** using multi-dimensional country-level data. The dataset includes annual data spanning from **1990 to 2011** for most countries globally, sourced from the **World Bank Climate Change dataset**.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes a rich variety of indicators for each country-year pair:

- **Emissions Data**: CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, and other greenhouse gases.
- **Population Metrics**: Total population, urban population, population growth rate.
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP, GNI, foreign direct investment, etc.
- **Agriculture and Land Use**: Agricultural land percentage, cereal yield, protected land areas.
- **Climate and Environment**: Annual precipitation, frequency of natural disasters.
- **Energy**: Energy use per capita and total.
- **Health and Infrastructure**: Counts of healthcare personnel, infrastructure stats, etc.

## Project Objectives

1. **Explore and clean** the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
2. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to discover key patterns and correlations.
3. **Engineer features** to improve model performance and interpretability.
4. **Train machine learning models** to predict CO₂ emissions.
5. **Evaluate** model performance using standard metrics.
6. **Visualize** the findings and predictions for better interpretability.
